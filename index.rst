Guidelines for User Support with the Rubin Community Forum
##########################################################

.. abstract::

   Guidelines for using the Rubin Community Forum to support the scientific community in their use of the data products, services, and tools created by the Rubin Observatory (or by other groups, e.g., brokers, independent data access centers). This primarily includes guidelines for answering users' questions and resolving issues, but also for posting Rubin-related news and announcements, enabling science discussions and collaboration, and settings to make accounts identifiable as Rubin staff.

Overview
========

The Rubin Community Forum (hereafter, the Forum) is based on the Discourse platform and can be found at the URL community.lsst.org.
Much of its content is publicly visible, and anyone may make an account and make posts (i.e., Rubin data rights are not required).

**The Forum’s primary use case is user support.**
Anyone may ask a question about the Rubin Observatory’s data products, services, and tools; the Support category is dedicated to questions from users.

A traditional, closed help desk won’t scale well to the anticipated 10000 scientists and students.
This open platform enables self-help (i.e., users can search for similar questions) and crowd-source solutions (anyone may chime in with answers), while also providing the capabilities for Rubin staff to moderate posts and follow-up on unsolved issues.
The secondary use cases of the Forum are dispersing information on news, events, and opportunities, and enabling scientific discussion and collaboration.

This document contains guidance and best practices for anyone providing support via the Forum.
This applies mainly to Rubin staff, but also representatives of broker and IDAC teams using designated Support sub-categories for their user support.
Members of the broader Rubin community do not need to read or follow this guidance when posting in the Forum.

This technical note supersedes the Interim Model for Community Support in `DMTN-155 <https://dmtn-155.lsst.io/>`_, and provides additional, practical details on the Model for Community Support in `RTN-006 <https://rtn-006.lsst.io/>`_.

User support
============

Answering users questions and resolving reported issues is the primary function of the Forum.

The Support category
--------------------

The Support category is entirely dedicated to answering user questions.

**Topic types:**
The only new topics posted in this category should be questions and issues reported by users.
No news, announcements, or discussion topics should be posted here.
All types of questions and issues are encouraged: "naive" questions; bug reports; account access issues; technically complex questions; inquiries about scientific analysis; and so on.

**Marked solutions:**
The marked solution functionality is enabled for this category.
Once the threaded reply post that answers the question is marked as the solution, it floats to the top of the thread and the topic gets a checkmark icon that identifies it as "solved".

**Daily monitoring:**
This category is monitored by the Rubin Community Science team who follow up on all unsolved topics.
The broker and IDAC subcategories are monitored by members of the relevant teams.


Goals, metrics, and principles for user support
-----------------------------------------------

In providing support to users via the Forum, there are two goals:

#. The topic gets a marked solution.
#. The user has a positive experience.

The metrics, principles, and guidelines are designed to achieve these two goals.

**Metrics:**
The Rubin Community Science team tracks several quantities as key metrics to assess how well the goals are being met.
The Discourse platform, on which the Forum is based, has built-in tools that track the number of new users, visits, topics, posts, etc. as a function of time.

On a weekly basis, the number of new vs. solved Support topics is compared to make sure reported issues are being solved.

On a yearly basis, the number of accepted solutions and the time to first response are reviewed to ensure all issues got solutions, and that the time to first response was <24 hours on average.
The number of daily engaged users is also reviewed and indicators of whether users are having positive experiences.

**Principles:**
All responses to user support requests should be formulated with the goals in mind, and aim to incorporate the following principles.

Prompt.

* All new Support topics should have a first response within 24 hours.
* Reply posts that can be immediately marked as the solution are best.
* Partial answers are OK.

Direct.

* Answer the user’s question directly, as they’ve written it.
* Avoid hypothesizing on their use-case scenario.
* Avoid unnecessary commentary or questions.

Validated.

* Do not guess.
* Test and confirm a solution works before posting.

Inclusive.

* Use language that is simple and kind.
* Avoid jargon, acronyms, sarcasm, and jokes.
* Offensive or exclusionary language is never permitted.
* See the Code of Conduct for additional guidance.

Referenced.

* Provide hotlinks to relevant documentation where applicable.

Guidelines for providing user support
-------------------------------------

Practical advice on how to provide user support in a way that is consistent with the goals and principles.

For everyone
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Encourage use of the Forum.

* Direct users to the Support category.

* Reassure them that all questions are appropriate and welcomed.

  * E.g., *"This is a great question, could you post it as a new topic in the Support category of the Rubin Community Forum at community.lsst.org? We’ll follow-up on it there."*


Provide validated examples that can be marked as the solution.

* Guesses or potential answers cannot be marked as a solution, and are not preferred.

  * E.g., *"You might want to look in the lsst geom or afw packages"* is not preferred.

* An answer that has been tested and confirmed to work can be marked as the solution by the support provider when it is posted; this is much preferred.

  * E.g., *"Here is some example code that imports the lsst.geom package and uses the radToDeg function to ..."* (followed by copy-pastable code block) is preferred.


Coordinate responses offline and follow up later, when needed.

* Full, validated solutions can take time and collaboration to develop; that’s OK.

* Avoid @-mentions in the thread to people who “might know”.

* Provide an expected timeline without shutting down further conversation:

  * E.g., *"Myself and the <team> team will work on a solution and report back within a week. In the meantime others are encouraged to chime in on this thread."*


Be familiar with the Forum’s functionality.

* Review the banner instructions and the topics tagged with "forum-howto".

* E.g., how to mark solutions, format code and math, and flag posts.


For Rubin staff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make your Forum account recognizable as Rubin staff by updating your account preferences.

* Adopt a username and name that are recognizable as you.

  * E.g., "MelissaG" is preferred to "CookiesForever3000" or "mlg".

* Change your profile picture from the default.

  * It need not be a picture of you.

  * The point is to look like an active account.

* Join the LSST group (https://community.lsst.org/g/LSST).

* Choose "LSST" as your "Title".

* Fill out your profile’s "About Me", timezone, and institute, at minimum.
